                <p className="mb-8">Let me take you back a little bit. My parents immigrated to the Houston area from Mexico in order to give me a better life. I grew up the oldest of 3 boys, often being the translator, babysitter, and my dad&apos;s assistant on quite a few jobs. He taught me a little bit of everything including plumbing, painting, construction, and electrical work.</p>
                <p className="mb-8">In high school, I tried everything from band, football, and robotics. Computer science class was one I enjoyed, taking every class the school offered, including a study hall my senior year where I developed an iOS app. I graduated in the top 7% of my class which allowed me to be automatically admitted into any TX public state universities. I decided to do a year of community college to save some funds while also being a full time intern at the Shell oil refinery. Fun times of full-time work and school!</p>
                <p className="mb-8">I moved to Austin to attend The University of Texas and began my Computer Science journey. After a year I realized I really enjoyed leading study groups and that I wanted to have a career that gave back to society. So I switched to a B.S. in physics and mathematics along with a teaching certificate. </p>
                <p className="mb-8">The rest is laid out in my experiences page and resume. I graduated and went to teach high school. Fufilling, tough, but just not enough pay. Especially these days. I had to make the tough decision to go back to the tech skills I had. I still have a passion for education and volunteer teaching kids how to code. Hopefully one day I can blend my passion for education and my tech career.</p>
                <p className="mb-8">In my off time I like to enjoy nature, play sports, and play/watch live music. I love collaborating with people and a team. Feel free to reach out if you&apos;d like to get to know more!</p>
